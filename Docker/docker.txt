#######Dockerfile
as we dont need to install software by going inside the OS we can do that by using Dockerfile
# so there is no need of enter install exit commit 
steps for Dockerfile
    FROM
    ADD
    RUN
    CMD 
    ENTRYPOINT
    ENV

ex:-
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get-y install apache2
ADD . /var/user/Desktop
ENTRYPOINT apachectl-D FOREGROUND
#USE ENTRYPOINT INSTEAD OF CMD
ENV name Devops intellipaat


> docker build . -t new-docker-file
> docker usermod -aG docker $USER #AUTO LOGIN 
>> so new image is created after build
> docker run -it -p 84:80 -d new-docker-files
###localhost:84
